"A 22-member Bangladeshi delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists have begun a 10-day visit to China."
"They will be having talks with Chinese government officials and senior members of the ruling Communist Party, a delegation leader confirmed with the BBC."
Analysts say China is making overtures while diplomatic tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India on a range of issues.
This includes ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina living in exile in India.
Dhaka has requested her extradition but Delhi has refused.
"Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior official from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who's leading the delegation in Beijing, told the BBC: ""It's basically a goodwill visit, initiated by Beijing."""
"""It is unique because China this time has invited a team representing various groups in Bangladesh."""
Many of the delegation members are from the BNP and its allies.
"The BNP, headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, is one of the main parties in Bangladesh, besides the Awami League led by Hasina."
The delegation also includes several representatives from the student movement that began the mass uprising against Hasina that eventually ousted the prime minister in August last year.
"An interim government, led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is currently in charge."
"It has been urging India to repatriate Hasina to face charges of crimes against humanity and money laundering, among other allegations."
"The UN says Hasina's government's crackdown on protesters during the uprising killed about 1,400 people."
"So far India has showed no sign of extraditing Hasina, who denies the charges."
"Delhi and Dhaka had maintained close ties during the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina, who was widely seen by her critics as pro-India."
"While maintaining close ties with Delhi, she balanced it with her relationship with Beijing."
"After the fall of Hasina, Beijing has stepped up its interaction with Bangladeshi leaders, activists and delegations, including from Islamist parties."
This week's visit follows a meeting between the Bangladesh interim government's foreign policy advisor Touhid Hossain and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing in January.
"It also marks the second time BNP officials have visited China in recent months, after Beijing hosted a BNP delegation late last year."
"With the political vacuum and absence of India's influence, analysts say, Beijing is trying to increase its foothold in Bangladesh, a country of about 170 million people."
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner with bilateral trade amounting to around $24bn (£19bn) - the vast majority of that consists of Chinese exports to the South Asian country.
The Bangladeshi military also heavily relies on Chinese equipment and ammunition with more than 70% of supplies coming from China.
"Compared to Beijing's overtures, India has had very limited interactions with the interim government and other Bangladeshi political leaders in the past six months."
The BNP held a protest in December alleging India's interference in Bangladesh's internal matters by hosting Hasina.
Some advisors of the interim government have also criticised Delhi on the same issue.
This criticism has sparked sharp reaction from Delhi.
"The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that it was up to Bangladesh to decide on ""what kind of relationship they want with us""."
"He described the criticism of India by Bangladeshi officials and politicians as ""absolutely ridiculous""."
Some argue that this increasingly tense rhetoric between Dhaka and Delhi could push Bangladesh towards China.
"The latest events indicate that Bangladesh has joined fellow South Asian countries Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal as a target for both Delhi and Beijing, as the superpowers jostle for influence."
"""I don't believe India should consider the whole subcontinent is under Delhi's sphere of influence."
"That attitude would make India suffer,"" Chinese analyst Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Beijing's Tsinghua University, told the BBC."

"Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won, but Germany's 2025 election has thrown up some important and fascinating stories that reveal a country in flux."
"Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament."
"Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote."
"Look at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west."
"In the east it's a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig."
"In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape."
"But the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone."
For one in five Germans it has become normalised.
"""They're just normal people,"" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland."
"Even though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a ""firewall"" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two."
"The AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist."
"Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants."
"The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called ""remigration"", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes."
But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants.
In May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation.
"Judges found that the AfD had ""positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy""."
"In three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist."
"A leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan ""Alles für Deutschland"" - everything for Germany."
"Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase ""Alice für Deutschland""."
"Not since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west."
Four years ago it was 76.6%.
"Put simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out."
"It reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country."
"There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience."
"The three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics."
"The leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first."
Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years.
But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years.
"It was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness."
"Although Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics."
Greens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.
"Until a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs."
"Wagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament."
"The story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign."
"Heidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD."
"She now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views."
Her party secured just under 9% of the vote.
"Die Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV."
"Alice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek."
"She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok."
"For the over-35s, it was the Christian Democrats who won out, and more men than women."
The leader of the Christian Democratic Union is now in pole position to become Germany's next chancellor.
Friedrich Merz will try to form a coalition after his Christian Democrats won less than 30% of the vote.
"Friedrich Merz heralds a new era for Europe without the US as a key partner, writes Europe editor Katya Adler."
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to become the second biggest force in the country.

"The UK has been ""fooled"" into believing international law alone can keep global peace, according to Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch."
"In a speech on Tuesday, Badenoch will say the UK should ""review"" its foreign policy strategy and put British interests first."
Badenoch hinted last week that she may advocate for pulling the UK out of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).
"She will be making her speech during a key week for international diplomacy, with both Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron travelling to the White House to discuss the war in Ukraine and smooth relations with the Trump administration."
"Badenoch will say on Tuesday that ""the world has changed"", leaving the UK ""not ready"" to deal with modern crises."
"The Conservative leader will argue the UK must also change and act in its national interest by protecting ""its borders, its values and its people""."
"""Strengthening Britain must be the principal objective at the heart of everything we do,"" she will say."
"""We have let ourselves be fooled into believing that international law alone can keep the peace"" when ""faced with a regime with no respect for the law""."
Her speech will be delivered a day after a series of international events to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"Discussions around peace talks have rapidly evolved over the past week after US President Donald Trump opened negotiations with Russia, in a meeting which excluded Ukraine."
President Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war and has claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin also wants to reach a deal.
"Meanwhile, there has been a deepening rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky."
"Zelensky has accused the US president of helping Russia ""break out of years of isolation"" before Trump turned his ire on the Ukrainian leader, calling him a ""dictator"" and suggesting his country started the war."
"On Thursday, Sir Keir will visit the White House to make the case for Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace talks, warning that an insecure settlement without security guarantees for Kyiv could embolden Russia to attack again."
"The prime minister also signalled a shift in the government's approach to bringing about peace, including stepping up UK military support and taking a bigger role in Europe's security."
Trump has been putting pressure on European Nato allies to increase their defence spending.
"In her speech, Badenoch will also advocate for further investment in defence and argue the government ""must do what it takes to protect Britain""."
"The Conservatives ran on a manifesto pledge to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP by 2030, but in recent days have pressed Labour to go further."
"""There will be painful decisions on government spending,"" Badenoch will say."
"""Any country that spends more interest on its debt than on defence, as the UK does today, is destined for weakness."""
"Badenoch will also reiterate her position that international courts are being used by charities and other organisations ""to advance an activist political agenda""."
The ECHR is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.
"The treaty was also recently cited in a case that allowed a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK, after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians."
"During the Conservative leadership election, Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a ""silver bullet"" to tackling immigration but last week said her party would review the ECHR and Human Rights Act."
"Responding to the speech, a Labour spokesperson said: ""If Kemi Badenoch was really the 'realist' she says she is, she'd be apologising to the British people for the damage she and her party did to our country."
"""Kemi Badenoch was part of a Conservative government which hollowed out our armed forces, made us more reliant on Putin for our energy needs and diminished Britain's standing on the world stage."
"""This Labour government is fixing the Tories' mess and delivering on our Plan for Change, the core foundations of which are economic stability, national security, and border security."""
The Tories have outlined a plan to make it harder for migrants to get indefinite leave to remain in the UK.
